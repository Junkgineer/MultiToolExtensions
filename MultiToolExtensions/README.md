# MultiToolExtensions
This is a pile of custom tools I regularly use, including:
- More expansive checks for different types of `NULL` and `default`.
- Database object URN parsing and creation.
- Single line updates to a project App.config.
- Single line string dump to file.
- Filename cleaning.
- A multitude of county, state and country ISO abbreviations.
- Social Security Number locator and sanitizer.
- Quick single line LevenshteinDistance and DamerauLevenshteinDistance comparisons.
- `RangeTuple` struct for handling more complex range calculations in strings, lists, etc.
- Random `Color` generator.
- Quick single line string index searches.
